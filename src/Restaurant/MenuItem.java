    The menu consists of several menu items
    Each menu item has a price, description, and category (appetizer, main course, or dessert)
    It should be possible to display whether a menu item is new or not
    The app should know when the menu was last updated, so visitors can see that the restaurant is constantly changing
     and adding exciting new items
